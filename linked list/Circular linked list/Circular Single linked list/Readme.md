# 📚 Singly Linked List in Java

---

## 📌 Description

This project implements a basic **Singly Linked List** in Java — a fundamental data structure used to organize data sequentially. It includes key operations such as:

* **Insertion:** At the beginning, end, or a specific position.
* **Deletion:** From the beginning, end, or a specific position.
* **Traversal:** To display all elements in the list.

---

## 🧠 What is a Singly Linked List?

A **Singly Linked List** is a linear data structure where each element, known as a **node**, contains two parts:

* **Data**: The value to store (in this case, a `String`).
* **Next**: A reference (or pointer) to the subsequent node in the list.

### Example Representation:

`[ A | next ] → [ B | next ] → [ C | null ]`

Unlike arrays, linked lists **do not require contiguous memory** and can grow dynamically at runtime, making them flexible for varying data sizes.

---

## 🌍 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine a **train** where:

* Each **coach** represents a `Node`.
* Each coach contains **passengers** (the `data`) and a **link to the next coach**.

You start at the engine (the `head` of the list) and move coach by coach using the link to reach your desired destination.

## 🏗️ Class Structure

### 🔹 `Node` Class

Represents a single node within the linked list. It consists of:

* `data`: Stores the string value.
* `next`: Points to the next node in the sequence.

### 🔹 `SinglyLinkedList` Class

This class encapsulates the methods required to manage the linked list:

* `insertAtBeginning(String data)`
* `insertAtLast(String data)`
* `insertAtPosition(String data, int position)`
* `deleteAtBeginning()`
* `deleteAtLast()`
* `deleteAtPosition(int position)`
* `traverse()`: Prints all elements in the list.

### 🔹 `single_linked` Class

This is the driver class containing the `main()` method, used to demonstrate and test all the implemented linked list operations.

## 🧪 Sample Output

```
List is empty.
A --->
B ---> A --->
B ---> A ---> D --->
B ---> A ---> D ---> C --->
B is deleted successfully!
A ---> D ---> C --->
C is deleted successfully!
A ---> D --->
A is deleted successfully!
List is empty.
```

## ✅ Key Features

* **Dynamic Memory Management**: No need to predefine the size, allowing the list to grow or shrink as needed.
* **Flexible Operations**: Supports efficient insertion and deletion at any position within the list.
* **Clean OOP Design**: Demonstrates good Object-Oriented Programming principles through encapsulation and method abstraction.

---

## 🔧 Suggestions for Enhancement

* **Naming Conventions**: Refactor method and variable names to adhere to standard `camelCase` conventions (e.g., `setData`, `getNextNode`).
* **Exception Handling**: Implement robust exception handling for invalid operations, such as attempting to access or delete from non-existent positions.
* **Generics**: Utilize **Generics** to allow the linked list to store any data type, rather than being limited to `String`.
* **Performance Optimization**: For certain operations, maintaining a `tail` pointer (in addition to `head`) can improve performance, especially for `insertAtLast`.
