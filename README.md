# 📘 Data Structures Project in Java

## 🛠️ About the Project

This repository contains implementations of essential **Data Structures** in Java. Each structure is implemented with proper object-oriented practices, meaningful method names, and example usage. The goal is to build a strong foundational understanding of how data structures work internally and how they can be implemented from scratch.

> ✅ Currently Completed Modules:
> - Pattern Programs
> - Singly Linked List

More structures will be added soon (e.g., Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph, etc.).

## 🔷 Pattern Programs

Pattern printing is a basic but essential topic in learning logic building and loops in programming. These programs often use nested loops to print structured output like pyramids, triangles, numbers, or stars.

### ✅ Key Concepts:
- Nested `for` loops
- Control of rows and columns
- Use of spacing and alignment

### 🧩 Sample Patterns:
```

> All pattern logic is implemented in **Java** with clean code and inline comments for better understanding.

## 🔗 Singly Linked List

A **Singly Linked List** is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains data and a pointer to the next node. Unlike arrays, it allows efficient insertions and deletions without the need for memory reallocation.

### ✅ Implemented Operations:
- Insert at beginning
- Insert at end
- Insert at a specific position
- Delete from beginning
- Delete from end
- Delete from a specific position
- Traverse the list

### 💡 Why Linked List?
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Efficient insertions and deletions compared to arrays
- Ideal for situations where frequent changes in the list are expected

### 📌 Implementation Language:
All operations are implemented in **pure Java**, with custom `Node` and `SinglyLinkedList` classes.

## 🚧 Work In Progress

Future additions may include:
- Stack (Array & Linked List)
- Queue
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
- Trees and Graphs
- Searching and Sorting Algorithms

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
````

2. Compile the Java files

   ```bash
   javac fileName.java
   ```
3. Run the program

   ```bash
   java className
   ```

## 📎 Notes

* Code is beginner-friendly with proper comments.
* Each data structure is kept in a separate file/module for modularity.
* Contributions or suggestions are welcome!

Let me know when you finish more sections (like Stack or Queue), and I can help you extend the `README.md` with matching structure and summaries.
